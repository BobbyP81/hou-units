# Subject Areas
The following subject areas have to be used throughout the use cases:
- 100 General
- 200 Events
- 300 Trading
- 400 Guild Bank
- 500 Events
- 600 Services
- 700 Transactions
- 800 Security
- 900 Web API

Use cases shall not be part of multiple subject areas. If the need for multiple subject areas arises, the use case may either be split, or assigned to the greater subject area.

# Use Case Numbering
All use cases have to be numbered with three digits: `###`. The first digit describes the _Subject Area_, whereas the second and third digit are numbered within the area (see `Subject Areas` above).  
The numbers have to increment by `1`. Starting with `001`, `002`, `003`, etc, for each subject area.

# Use Case Naming
Use case names should only contain the letters a-z and A-Z, as well as the space character.  
They should be unique, and descriptive enough to understand what the use case will contain.

# File Names
Each file name has to represent the use case name, following this format: `UC### ???`  
Whereas the `###` are replaced by the use case number, and the `???` is replaced by the use case name.
